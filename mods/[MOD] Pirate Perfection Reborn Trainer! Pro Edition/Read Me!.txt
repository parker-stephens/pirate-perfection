-- F.A.Q. :
Q? My DLC items locked again/DLC unlocker isn't working/DLCs aren't working, what to do ?
A! Look into config.lua and set DLCUnlocker to true. (DLCUnlocker = true)
	We disabled it by default, because it causes kicks/cheater tags for using DLC item you don't own (see colored list below for more information)

Q? Why achievements are not working ?
A! Because stats synchronisation disabled by default, you can enable in config.lua by changing NoStatsSynced = true to NoStatsSynced = false Just make sure you will set your profile visibility from public to otheA!

Q? Name spoofing broken, fix it!
A! Name spoofing is fixed for premium members as of version 1

Q? My game crashes with error "Engine stopped working" after I installed traineA! How to fix it ?
A! In 99% of cases that means you installed Trainer wrong or have other mods installed, like Hoxhud.
	Try to reinstall Trainer properly and everything should work fine.
	If you're 100% sure that you installed Trainer properly, then you can create new topic in "Support" forum section and we'll try our best to help you.

Q? I've installed Trainer, but nothing works or shows up, what I have to do?
A! To repeat, Trainer will not work on Windows XP.
	Uninstall old versions of Pirate Perfection (applies only to those, who still have v16), uninstall other lua mods/Trainers.
	Make sure you unpacked everything from release folder to main game folder!
	Also delete file called "PD2APIDLL1.dll".

Q? How to enable *some option* ?
A! Checkout config.lua and explore menus.

Q? NVAPI error in dll hook, how to fix it ?
A! Try to run game as Administrator

Q? Do Trainer have *some feature* ?
A! Maybe we will write full list of what Trainer can do, but why not to explore it yourself ? ;)

Q? Can I be banned from using this Trainer ?
A! No way!
	And I doubt if OVERKILL will care to add some kind of banning system.
	Currently you can be visually marked on client's or server's side if you spawn illegal equipments from server and client side or illegal bags from client side.
	Though in next big update, they will mark you for having DLC item/heist without actually owning it.

Q? I have CHEATER tag above my name, I didn't used cheats. Will you ever fix this ?
R. Recently OVERKILL added code to verify ownership of DLCs.
	In case you have some DLC item from DLC you don't own, host will see CHEATER tag above your name and also you maybe automatically kicked, if server choosed to do so.
	Though it is applicable that you used some cheat randomly.
	We currently trying our best at fixing this issue.
	If we'll manage to get something working it will probably appear only for Donor/VIP/Patron users, but not sure if we'll ever succeed.

This is list of things these will give you cheater tag for game session/kick you outta game if you're client (if server choosed to do so):
	From client side:
	 - Spawning equipment, different from last equipment you spawned.
	 - Throwing more, than allowed amount of grenades. (Picking up grenade from grenades crate case increases limit)
	 - Spawning more than allowed amount of equipments.
	 - Attempting to secure bag different from what you currently carring. (When you secure bag, host suspects that you no longer have any bags)
	 - Attempting to spawn bag different from what you currently carring. (When you drop any bag, host suspects that you no longer have any bags)
	 - Wearing item from DLC you don't own (The most common way of being detected)

	From server side:
	 - Spawning equipment, different from last equipment you spawned.
	 - Throwing more, than allowed amount of grenades. (Picking up grenade from grenades crate case increases limit)
	 - Spawning more than allowed amount of equipments.
	 - Wearing item or hosting heist from DLC you don't own (The most common way of being detected)
